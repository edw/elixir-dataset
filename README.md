# Dataset

Dataset provides a simple abstraction for managing tabular sets of data.

Datasets are enumerable and collectable. They can also be
rotated. Eventually they will be queryable via
[Relate](https://github.com/edw/elixir-relate).

## Installation

Dataset can be installed by adding `dataset` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:dataset, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```
